# G1 · Game Look — status

Prompt: [`G1_PROMPT.md`](G1_PROMPT.md). Art direction: [`ART_DIRECTION.md`](ART_DIRECTION.md).

## Now

- **Current checkpoint:** G1.1 Art direction and mockups — done.
- **Next step:** G1.2 game shell (title, loading with real stages, mode select, pause, results, settings, Recordings).

## Setup facts

- PR #25 is **open, not merged** → branched from `origin/v2/m5-focus` (`ddc3718`), then
  merged `origin/v2/m6-foundations` (`984b2cf`) once (merge commit `b9b42d4`, no conflicts).
- Branch: the session's designated branch **`claude/serene-davinci-v9y796`** (this cloud
  session may only push there). The prompt names `v2/g1-game-look`; Gautham can rename the
  branch or open the PR from it as he prefers. No force-push; nothing merged into main.
- Environment: cloud container (Xeon 2.1 GHz × 4, SwiftShader, no GPU, no ROS, no phone).

## Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | State | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1.0 Baseline | done | [`data/baseline/BASELINE.md`](data/baseline/BASELINE.md), [`screens/before/`](screens/before/) |
| G1.1 Art direction, mockups | done | [`ART_DIRECTION.md`](ART_DIRECTION.md), [`mockups/`](mockups/) (HTML in `mockups/src/`, rendered by `lab_web/tools/g1/render_mockups.mjs`); Chakra Petch + Inter added to `docs/v2/DESIGN_ASSETS.json` (OFL-1.1, self-hosted) |

## Gautham: look at these

- Before screenshots: `docs/v2/g1/screens/before/*.png`.
- **Mockups (G1.1)**, each at 915 × 412 and 1440 × 900: `docs/v2/g1/mockups/` — `play-fetch` (Fetch Rush HUD, GRAB ring filling), `play-fetch-keys` (desktop key hints), `play-free` (Free Drive, Vision on, GO), `play-refused` (greyed GRAB "Too wide", AUTO on, contact flash, forklift toast), `title`, `loading` (real stages), `modes`, `pause`, `results` (values: the Fetch Rush seed-1 reference card). The 3D backdrop is a hand-drawn SVG stand-in, not the renderer.

## Laptop items pending

- ROS package suites (`scripts/run_all_package_tests.sh`): not runnable in the cloud.
- Anything needing a real GPU, `gz`, the Nothing Phone (1) over USB.

## Questions for Gautham

- None yet.
